## 📝 **Notes**

This document serves as a comprehensive guide for re-implementing features that were removed during the Lovable.dev cleanup phase. The cleanup was necessary to:

1. **Fix build errors** - Remove broken imports and non-functional code
2. **Improve maintainability** - Clean up placeholder code that would confuse users
3. **Ensure stability** - Remove services that would crash the application

The features listed here represent the gap between the current MVP-ready state and a fully production-ready application. Priority should be given to Critical and High Priority items for production deployment.

**Last Updated**: December 2024
**Status**: Ready for implementation planning
